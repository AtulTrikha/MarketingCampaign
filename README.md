The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y). Data explored is from a Portuguese Bank Marketing Data Set from the following site: [UCI Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing). #### Business ProblemThe goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (variable `y`) based on various features from the marketing campaigns. The bank aims to optimize its marketing strategy to maximize successful subscriptions.#### Data UnderstandingThe dataset consists of various attributes related to the client, such as age, job, marital status, education, and past campaign outcomes. The target variable is `y` which indicates if the client has subscribed to a term deposit (`yes` or `no`).#### Data Preparation1. **Loading the Data:**   Download the dataset and load it into a pandas DataFrame.2. **Data Cleaning:**   Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.3. **Feature Engineering:**   Create or modify features to improve model performance.4. **Splitting the Data:**   Divide the dataset into training and test sets.#### Resources[Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing) <br>[Notebook](https://github.com/AtulTrikha/MarketingCampaign/blob/main/WillClientSubscribeTermDeposit.ipynb)---#### Classifier Performance ComparisonFour classifiers were trained and evaluated:1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)2. Logistic Regression (LR)3. Decision Trees (DT)4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)Below are the performance metrics for each classifier:### Logistic Regression Classifier- **Mean Fit Time:** 0.24 seconds- **Train Score:** 59.58%- **Test Score:** 59.71%- **Accuracy:** 59.43%- **Precision:** 56.14%- **Recall:** 85.10%- **Specificity:** 33.91%- **Train MSE:** 0.4032- **Test MSE:** 0.4010### Decision Tree Classifier- **Mean Fit Time:** 0.37 seconds- **Train Score:** 59.21%- **Test Score:** 59.17%- **Accuracy:** 75.92%- **Precision:** 72.76%- **Recall:** 82.64%- **Specificity:** 69.24%- **Train MSE:** 0.1879- **Test MSE:** 0.2387### K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier- **Mean Fit Time:** 0.21 seconds- **Train Score:** 76.44%- **Test Score:** 72.95%- **Accuracy:** 72.41%- **Precision:** 69.89%- **Recall:** 78.44%- **Specificity:** 66.41%- **Train MSE:** 0.2356- **Test MSE:** 0.2705### Support Vector Machines- **Mean Fit Time:** 3.72 seconds- **Train Score:** 63.39%- **Test Score:** 64.01%- **Accuracy:** 62.34%- **Precision:** 58.03%- **Recall:** 77.48%- **Specificity:** 48.40%- **Train MSE:** 0.3684- **Test MSE:** 0.3740### Interpretation of Results1. **Logistic Regression:**   - **Strengths:** High recall (85.10%) indicating a strong ability to identify clients who will subscribe.   - **Weaknesses:** Lower precision (56.14%) and specificity (33.91%), leading to a higher number of false positives.   - **Use Case:** Useful for campaigns where identifying as many potential subscribers as possible is critical, even at the risk of some false positives.2. **Decision Tree:**   - **Strengths:** Balanced performance with high accuracy (75.92%) and precision (72.76%). Good recall (82.64%) and specificity (69.24%).   - **Weaknesses:** Slightly higher complexity and potential overfitting.   - **Use Case:** Suitable for situations where both identifying potential subscribers and avoiding false positives are important.3. **K-Nearest Neighbors:**   - **Strengths:** Good overall performance with a balanced accuracy (72.41%) and high recall (78.44%).   - **Weaknesses:** Slightly lower specificity (66.41%) and higher test MSE (0.2705).   - **Use Case:** Effective in scenarios where interpretability is less critical and performance is key.4. **Support Vector Machines:**   - **Strengths:** Decent recall (77.48%) and test score (64.01%).   - **Weaknesses:** Longest fit time (3.72 seconds) and lower precision (58.03%) and specificity (48.40%).   - **Use Case:** Best for complex, high-dimensional data where other models struggle, though fit time can be a concern.### Findings and Actionable Insights1. **Model Selection:** Decision Tree offers the best balance of accuracy, precision, recall, and specificity, making it the top choice for deployment.2. **Marketing Strategy:**   - **Logistic Regression:** Useful for broad campaigns aiming to reach as many potential subscribers as possible.   - **Decision Tree:** Ideal for targeted campaigns focusing on precision and reducing false positives.3. **Performance Optimization:** Hyperparameter tuning and ensemble methods could further improve model performance.### Next Steps and Recommendations1. **Deploy Decision Tree Model:** Implement the Decision Tree model for real-time prediction to optimize marketing efforts.2. **Monitor and Retrain:** Regularly monitor model performance and retrain with new data to adapt to changing customer behaviors.3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Perform grid search or randomized search for hyperparameter tuning to enhance model accuracy and performance.4. **Ensemble Methods:** Explore Random Forests or Gradient Boosting to combine the strengths of multiple models and improve overall performance.5. **Data Augmentation:** Use techniques like SMOTE to balance the dataset and improve predictions for the minority class.### ConclusionBy leveraging the Decision Tree model, the bank can effectively target potential subscribers, optimize marketing campaigns, and maximize subscription rates, ultimately increasing revenue and customer base. Regular monitoring and optimization will ensure sustained model performance and adaptability to market changes.
